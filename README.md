# Completed Calculator
This is the completed calculator. Run the code in the Calcualtor.cpp file. It imports important functions from the FUNCTIONS.cpp and OPERATIONS.cpp file, so those are also needed to run the file.

This is my first ever coding project at all. It's a very small project, but I thought it was interesting and very fun.
